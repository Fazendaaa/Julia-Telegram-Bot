    Field	Type	Description
    update_id	Integer	The update‘s unique identifier. Update identifiers start from a certain positive number and increase sequentially. This ID becomes especially handy if you’re using Webhooks, since it allows you to ignore repeated updates or to restore the correct update sequence, should they get out of order.
    message	Message	Optional. New incoming message of any kind — text, photo, sticker, etc.
    inline_query	InlineQuery	Optional. New incoming inline query
    chosen_inline_result	ChosenInlineResult	Optional. The result of an inline query that was chosen by a user and sent to their chat partner.

This object represents one button of the reply keyboard. For simple text buttons String can be used instead of this object to specify text of the button. Optional fields are mutually exclusive.

    Field	Type	Description
    text	String	Text of the button. If none of the optional fields are used, it will be sent to the bot as a message when the button is pressed
    request_contact	Boolean	Optional. If True, the user's phone number will be sent as a contact when the button is pressed. Available in private chats only
    request_location	Boolean	Optional. If True, the user's current location will be sent when the button is pressed. Available in private chats only

#=
This object represents a custom keyboard with reply options (see Introduction to bots for details and examples).

    Field	Type	Description
    keyboard	Array of Array of KeyboardButton	Array of button rows, each represented by an Array of KeyboardButton objects
    resize_keyboard	Boolean	Optional. Requests clients to resize the keyboard vertically for optimal fit (e.g., make the keyboard smaller if there are just two rows of buttons). Defaults to false, in which case the custom keyboard is always of the same height as the app's standard keyboard.
    one_time_keyboard	Boolean	Optional. Requests clients to hide the keyboard as soon as it's been used. The keyboard will still be available, but clients will automatically display the usual letter-keyboard in the chat – the user can press a special button in the input field to see the custom keyboard again. Defaults to false.
    selective	Boolean	Optional. Use this parameter if you want to show the keyboard to specific users only. Targets: 1) users that are @mentioned in the text of the Message object; 2) if the bot's message is a reply (has reply_to_message_id), sender of the original message.

    Example: A user requests to change the bot‘s language, bot replies to the request with a keyboard to select the new language. Other users in the group don’t see the keyboard.
=#

type ReplyKeyboardMarkup
    __keyboard::Array{ KeyboardButton, 1 }
    __resize_keyboard::Bool
    __one_time_keyboard::Bool
    __selective::Bool
end

#=
Upon receiving a message with this object, Telegram clients will hide the current custom keyboard and display the default letter-keyboard. By default, custom keyboards are displayed until a new keyboard is sent by a bot. An exception is made for one-time keyboards that are hidden immediately after the user presses a button (see ReplyKeyboardMarkup).

    Field	Type	Description
    hide_keyboard	True	Requests clients to hide the custom keyboard
    selective	Boolean	Optional. Use this parameter if you want to hide keyboard for specific users only. Targets: 1) users that are @mentioned in the text of the Message object; 2) if the bot's message is a reply (has reply_to_message_id), sender of the original message.

    Example: A user votes in a poll, bot returns confirmation message in reply to the vote and hides keyboard for that user, while still showing the keyboard with poll options to users who haven't voted yet.
=#

type ReplyKeyboardHide
    __hide_keyboard::Bool=true
    __selective::Bool
end

#=
This object represents one button of an inline keyboard. You must use exactly one of the optional fields.

    Field	Type	Description
    text	String	Label text on the button
    url	String	Optional. HTTP url to be opened when button is pressed
    callback_data	String	Optional. Data to be sent in a callback query to the bot when button is pressed, 1-64 bytes
    switch_inline_query	String	Optional. If set, pressing the button will prompt the user to select one of their chats, open that chat and insert the bot‘s username and the specified inline query in the input field. Can be empty, in which case just the bot’s username will be inserted.

    Note: This offers an easy way for users to start using your bot in inline mode when they are currently in a private chat with it. Especially useful when combined with switch_pm… actions – in this case the user will be automatically returned to the chat they switched from, skipping the chat selection screen.
    Note: This will only work in Telegram versions released after 9 April, 2016. Older clients will display unsupported message.

    __text::UTF8String

#=
This object represents an inline keyboard that appears right next to the message it belongs to.

    Warning: Inline keyboards are currently being tested and are only available in one-on-one chats (i.e., user-bot or user-user in the case of inline bots).
    Field	Type	Description
    inline_keyboard	Array of Array of InlineKeyboardButton	Array of button rows, each represented by an Array of InlineKeyboardButton objects
    Note: This will only work in Telegram versions released after 9 April, 2016. Older clients will display unsupported message
=#

type InlineKeyboardMarkup
    __inline_keyboard::Array{ Array{ InlineKeyboardButton, 1 }, 1 }
end

#=
Upon receiving a message with this object, Telegram clients will display a reply interface to the user (act as if the user has selected the bot‘s message and tapped ’Reply'). This can be extremely useful if you want to create user-friendly step-by-step interfaces without having to sacrifice privacy mode.

    Field	Type	Description
    force_reply	True	Shows reply interface to the user, as if they manually selected the bot‘s message and tapped ’Reply'
    selective	Boolean	Optional. Use this parameter if you want to force reply from specific users only. Targets: 1) users that are @mentioned in the text of the Message object; 2) if the bot's message is a reply (has reply_to_message_id), sender of the original message.
    Example: A poll bot for groups runs in privacy mode (only receives commands, replies to its messages and mentions). There could be two ways to create a new poll:
    Explain the user how to send a command with parameters (e.g. /newpoll question answer1 answer2). May be appealing for hardcore users but lacks modern day polish.
    Guide the user through a step-by-step process. ‘Please send me your question’, ‘Cool, now let’s add the first answer option‘, ’Great. Keep adding answer options, then send /done when you‘re ready’.
    The last option is definitely more attractive. And if you use ForceReply in your bot‘s questions, it will receive the user’s answers even if it only receives replies, commands and mentions — without any extra work for the user.
=#

type ForceReply
    __force_reply::Bool=true
    __selective::Bool
end
