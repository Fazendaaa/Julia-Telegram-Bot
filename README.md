>"_Julia_ is a high-level, **high-performance** dynamic programming language for technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of other technical computing environments. It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed **parallel execution**, numerical accuracy, and an extensive mathematical function library. Juliaâ€™s Base library, largely written in Julia itself, also integrates mature, best-of-breed **open source** C and Fortran libraries for linear algebra, random number generation, signal processing, and string processing."
